I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno. Before joining UNR, I received my Ph.D. in 2018 in Structural Engineering at the University of California, Davis, and my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Construction Engineering at the American University in Cairo, Egypt. My research interests are centered around improving the safety of civil infrastructure subjected to natural hazards. My research focuses on quantifying the performance of reinforced concrete structures under earthquake events, with an emphasis on predicting structural collapse. My work includes a combination of analytical modeling, computational simulation and code development, and experimental testing of structural systems. I have taught or assisted teaching a variety of engineering classes including engineering mechanics, structural analysis and design and structural dynamics. I have long been involved with the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) as a graduate student and young academic, and I currently hold a co-chair position of the EERI Younger Members Committee. I may be classified as a "moderate" rock climber, and I sing any time I am not actively developing numerical structural models.
