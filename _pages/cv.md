Education
======
* Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Davis, 2018
  * Area of Specialization: Structural Engineering, minor in Computational Mechanics
* M.Sc. in Construction Engineering, American University in Cairo, 2015
  * Area of Specialization: Structural Engineering and Construction Materials
* B.Sc. in Construction Engineering, American University in Cairo, 2011
  * Area of Specialization: Structures and Construction Materials
* Minor in Journalism and Mass Communication

Work experience
======
* Postdoctoral Scholar, Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno (2019 – present)
  * I design and perform computational research studies to quantify the near-field effects of earthquakes on reinforced concrete buildings.

* Graduate Student Researcher, Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE), University of California, Davis (2015 – 2018)
  * I created and validated a multiscale computational framework for improving the prediction of localized damage in reinforced concrete     structures subjected to earthquakes. I also introduced a regularized statistical approach to seismic demand models, which reduces       the uncertainty associated with predicting structural response using small sets of earthquake ground motion data.
